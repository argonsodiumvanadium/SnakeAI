# SnakeAI
### the snake thinks on its own<br>
this is ACTUALLY Artificial Inteligence I mean the implementation is bver basic and down to Earth well here is the technical explaination
- Algorithm<br>
  steepest hill climb<br>
  this was and I still rhink is a very bad choice I should have used a proper algorithm like breadth first search or something because the problem is irrecoverable or has a high risk,in other words if I move towards one direction it is impossible or exhausive to retain the previous state, and in steepest hill climb algorithm the snake chooses the route which looks good at that given instance, due to which you will see my algorithm fails at a given point (23 points on my system)
